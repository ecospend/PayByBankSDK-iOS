## Documentation

## Usage

*Note: Please look at [API Specifications & Developer's Guide](https://docs.ecospend.com/api/intro) for more details.*

### Onboarding

To start using our API, you need to onboard with us and get a Client Id (`client_id`) and Client Secret (`client_secret`) via email to <support@ecospend.com>. For onboarding we will need the following information:

- The full name of your company/organization
- An email address for your admin user (used as username)
- A mobile phone number for the admin user (used for two-factor authentication)

Once onboarded, a Client Id is generated for you and you will have access to our Management Console, through which you can generate your Client Secret(s).

- The `client_id` is created by Ecospend when your organization is registered with us.
- The `client_secret` is a security key that your administrator should create from the Management Console. This is not visible to or accessible  by the Ecospend team. Therefore, you should store it safely.
- The `access_token` is required for all subsequent requests to the API. You should keep it safe and secure during its lifetime. The lifetime is configurable.

You will be given separate pairs of Client Id and Client Secret for our `Sandbox` and `Production` environments respectively. Ecospend does not store these parameters; therefore, you need to keep them safe and secure.

- `Sandbox` environment should be used for testing purposes.
- `Production` environment should be used for released applications.

### Authentication

PayByBank SDK supports [Token-Based Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token) to access Ecospend Gateway APIs.

`PayByBank.configure` function should be called to access `access_token` before using APIs which requires authentication of PayByBank SDK. When `access_token` is expired, `PayByBank.configure` function should be called again. To generate `access_token`, check out the [Get Access Token](https://docs.ecospend.com/api/intro/#tag/Get-Access-Token) documentation.

```
PayByBank.configure(environment: <environment>)

// or

PayByBank.configure(environment: <environment>, 
                    accessToken: <accessToken>,
                    tokenType: <tokenType>)
```
